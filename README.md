[Documentation][docs-rs]

Rust library providing division and modulus variants:

* Floored division and remainder.
* Ceiled division and remainder.
* Euclidian division and remaider.

For every definition, we provide a `Div`, a `Rem` and a `DivRem` trait.

A `DivRem` variant of `std`â€™s truncated division is also provided for convenience.
